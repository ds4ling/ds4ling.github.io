    "text": "In this course students examine the fundamental principles of doing experimental research in linguistics. Specifically, the focus is on developing an in depth understanding of the experimental paradigms and statistical procedures used in sociolinguistics, phonetics, psycholinguistics, syntax, and corpus linguistics. Students will learn advanced techniques used to explore, tidy, visualize, and analyze data. We will also focus on how to make the aforementioned procedures reproducible and shareable. Students will develop a foundation in programming in R, as well as learning the most common tools at the disposal of todays data scientist (i.e. GitHub, Knitr, etc.). No prior experience with statistics or programming is necessary."

    "text": "Department rules and course policy\nThe course is designed to satisfy the learning goals of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. More information available at: http://span-port.rutgers.edu/learning-goals\n\nCommunication\nAll course communication will be via Slack. You should have received an email with an invitation link to join the course Slack. Some rules for using Slack:\n\nUse an identifiable username and add your picture to your profile.\nOnly the professor is allowed to use the @channel and @here mentions.\nWhile this is an informal communication channel, all rules of academic discourse apply.\nAsk and answer questions on the appropriate channel.\nCreate channels as needed, especially for group presentations.\n\n\n\nAttendance\nRegular class attendance is essential for successful completion of the course. More than 1 absence will have a negative effect on your final grade. Arriving to class ten minutes late is considered an absence. The 2nd absence and every subsequent absence after that will result in the loss of 5% point off the final overall course grade, regardless of reason. Keep in mind that while you have 1 “free” absence, on the day/s you miss you will not be able to earn participation points, and you will miss the material given in class. If you are absent, contact a classmate immediately to get the assignments and to keep up with the material scheduled in the syllabus. The instructor is not responsible to put you up to date. Do not send emails to the instructor asking for updates if you missed class (i.e. “I was absent today. Did we do anything important?”). More information regarding the university policy on self-reporting absences is available here: https://sims.rutgers.edu/ssra/\nAny planned absence that you are aware of ahead of time, such as religious holidays recognized by Rutgers University or Dean’s excuses, should be made up before the absence occurs. If you know that you will be absent, it is your responsibility to let the instructor know ahead of time. All holidays or special events observed by any religion will be honored for those students who show affiliation with that particular religion. Absences pre-approved by the RU Dean of Students (or Dean’s designee) will be honored. More information available here: https://scheduling.rutgers.edu/scheduling/religious-holiday-policy\n\n\nCode of academic integrity\nThe professor will initiate an academic integrity case against students suspected of cheating, plagiarizing, or aiding others in dishonest academic behavior. Students are responsible for reading and understanding the Code of Academic Integrity.\nExamples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, plagiarism, cheating, and aiding and abetting dishonesty. An example of plagiarism would be to submit a written sample which in part or in whole is not the student’s own work without attributing the source. Cheating includes allowing another person to do your work and to submit the work under one’s own name. Any work which is submitted for a grade must be 100% the student’s own work. If you are not sure when it is appropriate to seek help, please see the professor.\n\nPlagiarism is the use of another person’s words, ideas, or results without giving that person appropriate credit. Do not plagiarize.\nRutgers University Academic Integrity Policy: http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/\n\nFor more information\n\nhttp://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/\nhttp://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/avoid_plagiarism.\n\n\n\nStudents with disabilities\nRutgers University welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University’s educational programs. In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, a student with a disability must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation: https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/documentation-guidelines.\nIf the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus’s disability services office will provide you with a Letter of Accommodations. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. To begin this process, please complete the Registration form on the ODS web site at: https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/registration-form."
