## Notes

- Plot: Good plot and good interpretation. Nice job. You could have emphasized 
the fact that the interaction you hypothesized might be correct. In other words, 
the slope of the line for the older group appears to be steeper, i.e., the effect 
of age appears to be neutralized for people with high scores on the composite measure.
- Models: Perfect!
- You printed the model summary, but there doesn't appear to be any assessment of 
the model (i.e., normality of residuals, multicollinearity, etc.). 
- Results write-up: The model description is great. The interpretation of the results 
is nearly perfect. You are only missing the description of the interaction (similar to 
what I mentioned about the plot). You say "the size of the effect was modulated by 
language aptitude". Right after this sentence you need to say how, i.e., older learners 
with high composite scores had similar results on the proficiency measurement. In other 
words, the age effect appears to be somewhat neutralized by language aptitude.
