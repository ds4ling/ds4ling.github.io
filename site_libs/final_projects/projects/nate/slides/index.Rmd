#The Data

- no data of my own

--

- found a website (kosis.kr) with lots of data on things in Korea

--

- pulled one about drunk driving in 2016

--

- not linguistic, but relevant

---

#Import
```{r import, message = FALSE}
dddata <- read_csv("../data_raw/2016_dddata.csv")                #import data

head(dddata)                                                     #take a peek
```

---

#Tidy
```{r tidy, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ddclean <- dddata %>%                                         
  select(., - CountType) %>%                                  #not sure why this column exists
  gather(., January, February, March, April, May, June,       
         July, August, September, October, November, December,#get all the months in a single column 
         key = "month", value = "count") %>%                  
  spread(., key = "Category", value = "count") %>%            #Category column actually 3 variables
  filter(., ABV != "unspecified")                             #not necessarily helpful

ddclean <- rename(ddclean, timeofday = TimeOfDay, abv = ABV)  #don't like mix of upper/lowercase

```
---

#Much better!
```{r cleandata}
head(ddclean, 4)                                                 
tail(ddclean, 4)                                                  

```

#Research questions

- Are there more cases of drunk driving at night than during the day?

- Does the month have any effect on the number of cases? For example in a month with a major holiday, maybe we could expect more incidents.

- In the ABV column there is a value ">0.35%". Is there a greater rate of injury when this level of intoxication is acheived? 

---

#Descriptive Statistics

night and day?

```{r stattable, echo = F}

ddclean %>% 
  group_by(., timeofday) %>% 
  summarize(CasesMean = round(mean(log(cases), na.rm = T),2), 
            CasesSd = round(sd(log(cases), na.rm = T),2), 
            InjuriesMean = round(mean(log(injuries), na.rm = T),2), 
            InjuriesSd = round(sd(log(injuries), na.rm = T),2))%>% 
  knitr::kable(., format = 'markdown')
```

---

#Descriptive Statistics

by month?

```{r stattablemonths, echo = F}
ddclean %>% 
  group_by(., month) %>% 
  summarize(CasesMean = round(mean(log(cases), na.rm = T),2), 
            CasesSd = round(sd(log(cases), na.rm = T),2), 
            InjuriesMean = round(mean(log(injuries), na.rm = T),2), 
            InjuriesSd = round(sd(log(injuries), na.rm = T),2))%>% 
  knitr::kable(., format = 'markdown')
```


---

#Descriptive Statistics

high ABV vs. other ABV injuries

```{r stattableabv, echo = F}
otherabv <- ddclean %>%
  filter(., abv != ">0.35%" & abv != "unmeasured" & abv != "noncompliant")

highabv <- ddclean %>%
  filter(., abv == ">0.35%") 

```
| ABV        | Injuries as percent of cases | 
| :-         | :-                           | 
| over .35   | `r round(sum(highabv$injuries, na.rm = T)/sum(highabv$cases, na.rm = T), 2)` | 
| under .35  | `r round(sum(otherabv$injuries, na.rm = T)/sum(otherabv$cases, na.rm = T), 2)` | 

--

split a bit differently?

```{r stattableabv2, echo = F}
higherabv <- ddclean %>%
  filter(., abv == ">0.35%" | abv == "0.30%~0.34%") 
lowerabv <- ddclean %>%
  filter(., abv != ">0.35%" & abv != "unmeasured" & abv != "noncompliant" & abv != "0.30%~0.34%")
```

| ABV        | Injuries as percent of cases | 
| :-         | :-                           | 
| over .30   | `r round(sum(higherabv$injuries, na.rm = T)/sum(higherabv$cases, na.rm = T), 2)` | 
| under .30  | `r round(sum(lowerabv$injuries, na.rm = T)/sum(lowerabv$cases, na.rm = T), 2)` |

#Going forward

- fit models

- identify significant effects/interactions

- answer research questions
