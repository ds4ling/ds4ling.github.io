#What is the Functional Load Hypothesis?

As Anya Lunden so aptly put it, "The functional load hypothesis of Berinstein (1979) put forward the idea that languages which use a suprasegmental property (duration, F0) contrastively will not use it to realise stress." (2017).

---

#Reasoning

Besides my lack of personal data to analysize and interpret, I found that while doing my online presentation that Lunden could've handled her analysis a little better(or so I thought); and while the following presentation is clearly by a chump like me, I think that it at least discusses the problems with a major challenge to a theory such as FLH.
