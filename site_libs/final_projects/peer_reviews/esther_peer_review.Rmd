I can see in Michelle’s script that she first starts doing the nested model comparisons using glm. She reports (χ2(2) = 12.81, p < 0.002) stating that she found main effect of groups and reports the β ; SE; z; and p value in order to report the differences between groups. However on the last section of her analysis, in the relationship between morphology and subject acceptance she reports the anova value:

anova(mod_null, mod_group, mod_add, test = 'Chisq')
Analysis of Deviance Table

Model 2: respFactor ~ group
Model 3: respFactor ~ profEn + group
  Resid. Df Resid. Dev Df Deviance Pr(>Chi)

explaining the main effects of group, proficiency and group as well as English interaction. It is unclear why she reports differently in this last section and does not use the same analysis as her previous ones using the glm.  

Julio:

On Fig 1. Julio shows 5 items in total for DOM production. However, he later decides to take away the last two items of the plot since the controls did not produce DOM in both of those task. 

My question is if there was some kind of analysis like a t-test in order to reach to that conclusion. He does not report any kind of statistical analysis in order to remove those items from the later analysis. 

Also, I have a question in regards how he reported both negative and positive correlations. The first negative correlation means that the more the speaker is educated the less he will produce ungrammatical DOM and on the positive correlation it means that the more you speak Romanian the more you are going to be likely to produce ungrammatical DOM. Would you report this kind of data for publication (it seems as a negative perspective towards the L1). It seems that there should be a better way to report this kind of information, in a more positive or constructive way.
