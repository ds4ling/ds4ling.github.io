Hi Joseph,

Here are my comments on two of the projects (Nate’s and Francisco’s). I’ll paste the comments I made directly to their repos, with additional comments just for you (for each project). Thanks again!


Comments for Nate

Comments:
The paper benefitted from an intuitive structure and clear discussion of the results. The hypotheses were stated early in the paper, and were addressed throughout (instead of only at the end). The structure (descriptive statistics followed by plots followed by model information) of data presentation was helpful, allowing the reader to form a general picture about the data, so as to better understand the interpretation of the models.

Given the nature of the data, a binomial regression seemed to be the most appropriate model to use. Within each section, discussion of the slope estimates for the relevant predictor facilitated a clear understanding of the observed effect (or non-effect). The author provided an inverse logit estimate at 100, 200, and 300 cases, which contextualized the effect, and was more informative than simply stating the p-value. 

Questions:
In your code, I saw two generalized linear models, one with cases as the criterion and timeofday as a predictor, and one in which the two were flipped. Which one did you use for the paper (I assume it was the first one). What was the purpose of the second one? Was it a way to check the validity of the original model?

Also, what was the splitAt function doing? It looks like it's partitioning the abv column into >.35 and <.35, but I’m not exactly sure.

In the by-month comparison, did you find any significant effects for the month of April?

Suggestions:
I think the second hypothesis could have been explored in more detail. One thing you might consider is gathering the months in your hypothesis (Dec/Jan, Feb, Sep) into a single ‘holidays’ category and comparing that with mean of the rest of the year.

Another possibility (if the data is available) is to go by week. For example, let’s say there are significantly more cases around the week of new years, but that effect is obscured when collapsed over the mean of the month. If you could compare that week with the annual average (or even the month average), maybe it would see an effect.


Comments for Joseph:
I liked Nate’s project a lot. It was interesting to see the skills acquired in the class applied to non-linguistic data, and the paper was very clear and well-structured.

I found some issues with his code, though. I only saw two models in his script (each for the timeofday data), but none for the other two predictors. Also, the summaries in his manuscript file for those models looked like they were made manually (maybe I wasn’t looking in the right place). He did a good job of commenting on the code at the top of his script, where he tidied the data, but some of the manipulations he did toward the bottom (getting into the abv data) were hard to understand without commenting. Because of this, I think the reproducibility of his project took a bit of a hit.




Comments for Francisco

Comments:
This project builds on an earlier study which evaluates the FLH, and takes a different statistical approach. The introduction is strong and clearly states the main purpose of the paper.

The author describes the steps in reorganizing and tidying the original dataset, providing good justification for any variable exclusions, and includes examples of the resulting data frames.

Using a binomial regression model to analyze the data was appropriate for this project. The author stated which models he fit, and provided full summaries of these models in the text of the paper before interpreting the results. This is a clear and transparent way of presenting the findings, and is a strong point in favor of this project being considered reproducible. 

Questions:
Where are the results of the likelihood ratio test in your paper (using the anova() function)? I found the test in your code, and you mention it in the introduction, but I was unable to find it in the Results section.

Also, where in your code did you number the languages? I saw where you renamed the ‘lang’ column to X1, but couldn’t find where you changed the language names into numbers. How did you do that?

Suggestions:
Since your paper is an improvement on the statistical methods used in Lunden et al’s analysis, I think it would be helpful to provide more detail about what they did in their paper. You allude to comparative models in the introduction, but I’m not sure about the details. 

Building on that, I think that in your discussion/conclusion section, it would be good to explain why your models are an improvement on the original analysis. You come to the similar conclusions with respect to the validity of the FLH, but what is it about your model that justifies this result more clearly/intuitively/etc. than Lunden? I think this would give the conclusion a stronger punch.

Comments for Joseph:
I was impressed by Francisco’s work. The question of the FLH is still wide open, and so I think he made a great choice in what to focus on, as there is a lot of possible work to be done on this topic in the future.

Francisco’s code was clean and very easy to read. He didn’t have the sections marked off, but it was easy to tell where he was tidying his data, making his figures, and fitting his models. Also, it was concise and well-organized, without a lot of extra stuff to clutter it up.

There were some places where I felt he could improve, especially in his Results section. It was a bit too short, and I was confused by his interpretation of the results. Looking at his code, it was clear he knew what he was doing, but it looks like there was a disconnect when presenting that in the paper.



Thanks again for everything. This was such a great class! 

Sincerely,

Chris Oakden
