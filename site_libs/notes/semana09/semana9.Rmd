# Week 9: General linear model.

**Date**: Tuesday, 03/20 

**Topics**: 

- Stats: General linear model, dummy variables
- Programming: papaja continued, practice regression

**Plan**

- GLM slides (2 hrs!)
- Programming
	- download dummy practice zip
	- in pairs work through examples, 
	stop occasionally to do parts together
	- This is practice for the midterm
	- Focus on interpreting dummy variables, 
	nested model comparisons, and writing up results

**Notes**: 

Great class. Slides took a much longer time 
than expected, but the programming went much 
quicker. I supplied the students with the 
project folder as opposed to having them create it in class.
